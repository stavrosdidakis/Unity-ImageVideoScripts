### üñºÔ∏è `Slide Images`
**Sequential and Random Image Playback**
<img src="README/1.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

Displays images from a Resources folder in either **sequential order** or randomized, creating a dynamic and ever-changing scene.

```csharp
// Key Features:
- Load images from a user-specified Resources folder
- Display them one after the other or randomize the order
- Easily customizable via the Inspector
```

---

### üé≤ `Grid Images`
**Dynamic Grid of Random Images**
<img src="README/2.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

Creates a **5√ó5 grid** of planes, each displaying a random image from a Resources folder. Images update frequently, creating a lively, mosaic-like visual.

```csharp
// Key Features:
- Uses a plane prefab for easy setup
- Dynamically populates the grid with images
- Changes textures at short intervals for a flickering, energetic effect
```

### üé• `Grid Videos (16:9)`
**Adaptive Video Grid**
<img src="README/3.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

Generates a **dynamic grid** of video clips that adapts to different aspect ratios. Videos are pulled from a Resources folder and played in grid cells that automatically fill the canvas.

```csharp
// Key Features:
- Dynamically resizes grid based on random grid sizes
- Preserves video aspect ratios for clean visuals
- Smoothly transitions between grid configurations
```

### üåÑ `Image Splitter`
**Randomized Image Splitter with Shader Control**
<img src="README/4.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

Splits a region into sections, assigning each section a random image from a folder. Uses Perlin noise to animate rotation for a smooth, organic feel.

```csharp
// Key Features:
- Shader-driven dynamic image splitting
- Loads images from a configurable Resources folder
- Randomizes and animates image sections for a unique aesthetic
```

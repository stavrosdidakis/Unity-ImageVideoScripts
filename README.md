### üñºÔ∏è `Slide Images`

<img src="README/1.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

**Sequential and Random Image Playback:** Displays images from the Resources folder in either **sequential order** or **random"", creating an ever-changing content.

```csharp
// Key Features:
- Load images from the Resources folder
- Display the images sequantially or randomly
- Customize content via the Inspector
```

---

### üé≤ `Grid Images`

<img src="README/2.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

**Dynamic Grid of Random Images:** Creates a **5√ó5 grid** of planes, each displaying a random image from a Resources folder. Images update frequently, creating a mosaic-like visual.

```csharp
// Key Features:
- Uses a plane prefab for setup
- Dynamically populates the grid with images
- Changes textures at short intervals with a flickering effect
```

---

### üé• `Grid Videos (16:9)`

<img src="README/3.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

**Adaptive Video Grid:** Generates a **dynamic grid** of video clips that adapts to different aspect ratios. Videos are pulled from the Resources folder and played in the grid cells that automatically fill the canvas.

```csharp
// Key Features:
- Dynamically resizes grid based on random sizes
- Preserves video aspect ratios for a clean visual effect
- Smoothly transitions between grid configurations
```

### üåÑ `Image Splitter`

<img src="README/4.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

**Randomized Image Splitter with Shader Control:** Splits a region into sections, assigning each section a random image from a folder. Uses Perlin noise to animate rotation for a smooth, organic feel.

```csharp
// Key Features:
- Shader-driven dynamic image splitting
- Loads images from a configurable Resources folder
- Randomizes and animates image sections for a unique aesthetic
```

---

### üåÄ `Tunnel`

<img src="README/5.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

**Twisting Tunnel Video Effect Shader:** A **real-time shader** that maps a video texture onto a twisting tunnel effect. The tunnel moves forward and rotates over time for a continuous flow.

```glsl
// Shader Features:
- Video texture mapped as a twisting tunnel
- Adjustable tunnel size, speed, and twist frequency
- Dynamic animation for captivating visuals
```

---

### ‚ö° `Glitch Randomizer`

<img src="README/6.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

**Glitchy Chromatic Aberration and Stripes Shader:** A dynamic glitch shader that **randomly applies** chromatic aberration, wavy displacement, and alternating stripes to create intense glitchy visuals.

```glsl
// Shader Features:
- Chromatic aberration with adjustable displacement
- Animated wavy distortions and stripe glitches
- Randomized patterns for a constantly evolving glitch aesthetic
```
